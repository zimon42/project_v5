Step : Create a React app that outputs Hello world
--------------------------------------------------

https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app
Start command prompt by clicking the manifying glass and typing cmd.
cd C:\wamp64\www\miedweb\
npx create-react-app project_v4 (npx is not a spelling error)
cd project_v4
npm start

localhost:3000 doesnt work
Now it suddenly works! I didn't do anything fix it. Maybe it needn't some time to start the server

Now lets edit to show "Hello world"

Open VS Code and click File->Open Folder from the File menu

Edited the App.js file. It now shows Hello world!

Next lets install git

First create a remote repository at github

There were problem creating the account
Password has been compromised in a third party data breach

Chose a harder password - works now. Here is the info:
Username: zimon42
Email: simon.wrang2@gmail.com
Password: ilv23456

Next start a repository on github:

Had to verify email

Now it works

Now lets install git on my machine

git.init
echo >>gittest.txt
git add gittest.txt
git commit -m "first commit"

Gives message: "Please tell me who you are"

Added email and name

Now it worked

Hm, I never had to input my password to my remote repository at github when installing git, or creating the local repository on my machine. 

Now when i pushed, I had to enter it

Stuck. Clicked Enter on the keyboard, then it continued

Still displays Hello World despite ive created a NumberScroller component that should display "NumberScroller".

Restared server - still doesnt work.

Fixed import NumberScroller in App.js. Now it works!!

Setting width for text field to 25 px, but still is long

Broke the import. Yielded a compile error. Then changed back, and now it works. This is the second time this happens. Next time, break the import and then fix it, to make it works. 

Fixed problem: I kept only get one text field when I had three number scroller components. In NumberScrollerPanel, had export default NumberScroller; when I should have had
export default NumberScrollerPanel;

TypeError: Cannot read property 'val' of undefined. 
Solved: Changed from props.val to this.props.val. Removed props from render argument.

Next fix when click decrease button, decrease by one

Fixed so all buttons work!!

How do you comment several lines in React html ?
Use {/* */}

Number scroller list with array map works!!

Now I wanto save files (log.txt and src folder) to git

Did git add log.txt -- it worked

When doing commit, use -m flag, otherwise opens up some editor whish i don't know how to exit from.

How do you push to remote server?
git push origin master

Now that list works, what next?
Update the other vats

Updating other vats works!!

What to do next?
Add a lock button

Refactoring app with VatPanel etc
Stuck!

How do you indent a piece of selected code in vs code?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40492960/how-to-indent-format-a-selection-of-code-in-vscode-with-ctrlshiftf
Use Ctrl + ]? Its not working

Hello world not displaying when using three VatPanel where each VatPanel should output "Hello world"; Fixed: Forgot to add call to renderVatPanels method in render body

Cannot display image lock.png
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39999367/how-do-i-reference-a-local-image-in-react
Solution:
import img from './lock.png';
<img src={img} />

NumberScrollerVatPanelTitle class is not having any effect.
Solution: Injected a syntax error and then corrected it

How do I pass state down from top component to a component much fruther down in the hierarchy?
Pass entire vat (not vats) object down to VatPanel component

Now incHandler and decHandler shows alert

inc and decHandler need the index of the changed vat
My solution: pass another attribute "index" down the hierarchy.

Pressing buttons works!! Updates the other vats correctly

Next fix LockSetter

LockHandler method in VotePanel file alerts correct index

Bug: Created a new LockHandler method without an alert, but it still alerted. Finally I figured out I had already made a LockHandler method further down in the code that was being used.

isLocked works!

Soda
Coffee
Milk
Chocolate
Rejuvelac
Black tea
Green tea
Roibos
Broth
Mineral water
Average

HorizontalSlierVotePanel prints Hello world

Created state with 10 coca colas

How do I specify an image address without importing all of them?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42580130/display-images-in-react-using-jsx-without-import
Solution:
<img 
    src={ require("../images/"+this.props.vat.img)}
></img>

Shows soda images

Couldnt find module HorizontalSlider. Solved: forgot to add HorizontalSlider to path below
import HorizontalSlider from '../HorizontalSlider/HorizontalSlider

Don't forget to Save All!!!! That explains why I had to introduce a syntax error and then correct it to make the app work - files werent saved.

Problem: Slider bar anchored at bottom
Solution:
vertical-align: top

All 10 images displaying

Slider button graphics done!

Mouse down handler works!

I need to capture a mouse move event. But I wanto set it on the body element.
https://fortes.com/2018/react-and-dom-events/
Solution:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32485520/how-can-i-add-a-click-handler-to-body-from-within-a-react-component 

Next. Set val in vote panel and should move the button accordingly
Must set style={style} in horizontalSliderButton

Working on calculating left
Working!

Used "static" keyword to define constants in config.js

can drag slider buttons!
Slow in Google Chrome
Bug1: when clicking the slider button again, jumps to beginning
Bug2: Error "nweVal" is read-only,
at if (newVal < 0) newVal = 0;

Solution to bug2: We have defined newVal as a const but when passing slide endpoints we altered the value and therefor must be "let".

Solution to bug1: Forgot to set oldVal in state in mouseDownHandler. The value being used was instead 0 which was the value the state was initialized to.

Next: Update other slider buttons

All of a sudden slider button is fast again in Chrome. Removed console.log in render method that was being repeated every time the mouse moved.

Working on toSpare. Not working. Solved: Calculated newVal too high up, before dVal was reduced. Solved by moving newVal calculation after reducing newVal

Sorts array of indices works!

Moves other sliders almost works. But when one slider button gets too close to the end, it starts shimmering.

Bug: Moves each other slider as much as the slider being dragged. Solved:
dist = usedDVal / (arr.length-1);
Remove the -1:
dist = usedDVal / (arr.length);

Oops should be:
dist = usedDVal / (arr.length-i);

Still buggy. Flickering

index:1

HorizontalSliderVotePanel.js:138 distTo0:4.277777777777776
HorizontalSliderVotePanel.js:139 distAll:8.555555555555552
HorizontalSliderVotePanel.js:140 usedDVal:8.777777777777777
HorizontalSliderVotePanel.js:149 NOT distAll > usedDVal
HorizontalSliderVotePanel.js:137 index:2

HorizontalSliderVotePanel.js:138 distTo0:11.166666666666668

HorizontalSliderVotePanel.js:139 distAll:11.166666666666668
HorizontalSliderVotePanel.js:140 usedDVal:0.22222222222222499
HorizontalSliderVotePanel.js:145 distAll > usedDVal
HorizontalSliderVotePanel.js:189 mouseUpHandler

Seems to change mode when reached half way

Is oldVals not being updated?

Added this to mouseMoveHandler, but then speeds away
        // Set old vals
        let oldVals = new Array(this.state.vats.length);
        for (let i=0; i<oldVals.length; i++) {
          oldStateCopy.oldVals[i] = this.state.vats[i].val;
        }

Still working on this bug

Big improvement by using tempVals. 

Interesting: If sliders are oredered from top to bottom, no bug occurs.

Måste arrayen sorteras om?

Bug solved!!! Sorted on vat.vals when should have sorted on oldVats.

handleOthersSlider works in both directions!!

Next: Fix LockSetter

Toggles locksetter green and red borders

Next, if trying to drag slider with red lock: do not move. Done!

Next, do not move other sliders that are locked. Approach: in handleOtherSliders filter out arr with only unlocked indices. Works!

Next recalculate toSpare - works!

Next: Create router pages!

HomePage route displayes correctly, but cannot find modules AdminPage and VotePage.

New error: A <Router> may have only one child element"
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42992911/react-router-only-one-child
Solution: You have to wrap routes in a div

Working! The other error of not being able to find modules are gone.

Working on HomePage component

Vote link works!

Removed comments to show all ten vats but still only shows the six vats. Solution: Restarted the server

How do you deploy a react application togheter with php?

Next: Create a simple helloworld react app and try to deploy it (to githubpages?).

create-react-app helloworld

Created a remote repository "helloworld" on github. 

Deploy on gitpages:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yA7BGos2KQ&t=114s

Very good:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y-PqBH-htk

1. In package.json add:
"homepage": "https://zimon42.github.io/helloworld",
at top level.

2. Add "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
under scripts

3. Install gh-pages:
npm install --save gh-pages

4. Run deploy:
npm run deploy

5. Look at homepage: https://zimon42.github.io/helloworld

Hello world worked!

Tried deploying project_v4. Displays nothing. No errors.

Is it because im not using Hastroute as desribed in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yA7BGos2KQ&t=114s
?

Woo! Added, committed and pushed everything, and then deployed again and now the "Project v4" title shows. Try putting routes back. If it doesnt work, then use Hashrouter.

Ok doesnt work. Now use hashrouter

Didnt work, empty page

Ohh now it works without havnig done anything, seems to be a little delay for the changes to push onto the server!!

My address is:
https://zimon42.github.io/project_v4/#/

Make test app, helloworld2. Presses button, gets jquery get request and prints message.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNEle8zsoWg&t=178s

npm install jquery --save

https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ajax_get_post.asp

php file:
http://localhost/miedweb/helloworld2/src/helloworld2.php

Failed to load http://localhost/miedweb/helloworld2/src/helloworld2.php: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:3000' is therefore not allowed access.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=829ZO-bAvPA

"To make it avaialbe to all ... you need to enable the CORS"
"Cross Origin Resource Sharing"

https://enable-cors.org/server_php.html
header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *");

Works!

React:
  clickHandler = () => {
    $.post("http://localhost/miedweb/helloworld2/src/helloworld2.php",
    {
        name: "Donald Duck",
        city: "Duckburg"
    },
    function(data, status){
        let obj = JSON.parse(data);
        // alert("Data: " + data + "\nStatus: " + status);
        alert(obj.message);
    });
  }

Php:
<?php
header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *");
// echo "Hello world";
$arr = array("message" => "Hello World!!!");
echo json_encode($arr);
?>

Added IKEA header and insructions.

{vats:this.state.vats}
$_POST["vats"]

Working on vats php

Restarted computer. Dragging slides was slow. Noticed that writing text in Chrome textfield also was slow. Then it became fast again. So just have to wait for a while after starting the computer.

Create table Vats yielded sql syntax error. Solved: removed comma before closing parenthesis.

Syntax error in addVat. Solved: Missing comma after 12.

Add vats to table works. Next get Vats

componentDidMount not firing. But componentWillMount works. Is it because the warnings? Create small app "helloworld3" and see if it works there.
Solved: Ohhhh! Had defined componentDidMount upstairs in the code to include the mousemove listeneres.

Ajax call returns "Get Vats!!!"

PollHandlerDb error, pollId was still there.

Hm, id=1..8 from database. But we want 0..7. Does it matter?

Removed vats in state upstairs in the code. Get vats from backend. Get error: TypeError: Canno read property map of undefined, probably because vats have not been recieved yet as the ajax call is asynchronous. 

Error: cannot find green_tea.png. Solved: should be .jpg
Still error after changing init_vats.php. Solve: Must create tables again. Lets create a init_server script

Hm yields error. But when run on its own, init_vats works. But not inside the init_server script. So must run separately until we fix it.

Loaded vats, but spazz out. Could it be that 12 is inside "". 
Woo fixed it! Call parseInt on all vals in vat array.

Load vats now complete. Next handle vote

How handle decimal vals? Change the database to save vals as decimal numbers

Cant load vats. cant find Vote.php etc.

Now works!! Saves vote in Votes table

Hm vals saved as ints in database despite setting it to decimal.

Ah had to use two args: DECIMAL(10,5). Check w3schools for more details. 5 means 5 digits to the right of the decimal point. First had 3 as first argment as 100 has 3 digits. But got error that first argument must be greated than second argument.

Done for today, next make "Tack för din röst" page.

Thankyou screen seems to be working, but doesnt show "Laddar data" the second time.

Next fix Escape-key. What is the js name for the keypress event? "keypress". How do I check that it was the escape key that was pressed?

Caught other bug: TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined, row 70, 
mouseMoveHandler = (e) => {
  if (this.state.vats[this.state.vatIndex].isLocked.

So problem is moving mouse before the vats data has loaded. Check in beginning of moueMoveHandler if vats exist. If not, return;

Escape key not working. Deprecated code? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3369593/how-to-detect-escape-key-press-with-pure-js-or-jquery. THough that is jquery, but maybe i can use that instead

Escape key still not working. keydown works however. Lets use that instead

Now, how do I redirect back to portal when user has pressed escape key?
https://medium.com/@anneeb/redirecting-in-react-4de5e517354a

However cannot import. Found other page:
import { Redirect } from 'react-router'
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43230194/how-to-use-redirect-in-the-new-react-router-dom-of-reactjs
Still not working. Ooo, put the import in App.js but should be in VotePage.js

Ooo works! Redirect to portal

How should we design the admin page?

Prints history dates to console

Working on HistoryList component

How do we make a table?
How to concatenate jsx pieces
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36912179/how-to-concatenate-two-jsx-fragment-or-variables-or-string-and-component-in-rea/36913042

Creates table with item_i inside cells

Shows "drink" titles and draws blue bars. But why are only seven drink titles visible?

Next: add random votes.

Refactored out addVote - app still works, phew :-)

add_random_vote bug: in Votehandler vat-id does not match val-id. Solved: id's begin at 1 not 0.

Hm should yield 100 votes, not 1. Must use nested for loop

add_random_votes now works!

Next add colors

Oh no empty history! create_tables erased old history items

Displays colors!!

Now history looks real nice, with date header!

Creating new algorithm for add_random_votes. Bug: Iterated forever. Solved: $t should have been $t++ in for loop. Bug 2: VoteHandler.php: val id does not match vat id. Solved: $valsArr = array() was inside for loop, should have been outside.

New algorithm now works!

Next: Implement show statistics
Cannot find old stats page. Found it in vote_page.php

Send json encoded stats array to client -> displays array

Statistics page with diagram works! Although slow.
Oops should not be 8 but 100. Now fixed!

Back button in admin panel now works

Ok time to make everything global

Plan:
1. Deploy to githubpages.
npm run deploy

2. Test react app frontend. Note: that backend not setup yet. Only portal will work.
See address in package.json file: https://zimon42.github.io/project_v4

3. Move backend files to manufrog
Zip first.

4. Log into manufrog cpanel. Use username and password highest up on paper. Open Filhanteraren. Click public_html. Create folder momsapp_v4. Upload .zip file. Right click and choose extract.

5. Create database on manufrog: miedwebo_momsapp_v4
Lägg till användare i databas: miedwebo_root. 

6. Update database_info.php, check old file in old momsapp:
$polls_db_server = "127.0.0.1";
$polls_db_username = "miedwebo_root";
$polls_db_password = "abcdefgh123456";
$polls_db_database = "miedwebo_poll_database";
Change miedwebo_poll_database to miedwebo_momsapp_v4

7. Change config file backend_entry_file to miedweb.org/momsapp_v4/index.php
Run npm run deploy again

Then dont forget to change back to local backen_entry_file.

Error:
jquery.js:8478 Mixed Content: The page at 'https://zimon42.github.io/project_v4/#/admin/' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure XMLHttpRequest endpoint 'http://miedweb.org/momsapp_v4/backend/index.php'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.

Try changing to 'https://miedweb.org/momsapp_v4/backend/index.php' in config file (added the s)

Still same error. Right clicked and deleted cache. Now worked. Now Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://miedweb.org/momsapp_v4/backend/index.php' from origin 'https://zimon42.github.io' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

But I thought i had that header.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26416727/cross-origin-resource-sharing-on-github-pages. "Theres no way on github pages to support cross origin" :-(. But crossed out, says it supports it now.

From 2018 about setting up github pages:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKXkC4SqtRk

Google "how to enable cors on github pages".

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18923328/is-there-a-way-to-enable-cors-on-github-pages/25957840 "Is there a way to enable CORS for Github pages?"
"Github Pages now has CORS enabled.
The CORS header:
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Is added by default on all responses from Github pages!"
Hm not same thing. Is the problem with manufrog?

Ok, make minified program that just tests cors on github pages.

Plan:
1. Create react app:
Stand in c:\wamp64\www\miedweb and do create-react-app helloworld4

2. Start server: npm start

3. Install jquery: npm install jquery --save

4. Gets data correctly to local computer. That means manufrog is not removing the cors header. Next, move it to github pages

5. Create remote repo on github.
echo "# helloworld4" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/zimon42/helloworld4.git
git push -u origin master

6. Install git, follow above instructions.

7. npm run deploy. Page wont open.

Ok, helloworld project works, copy code to it.

Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()

Handle cors:
https://gist.github.com/jesperorb/6ca596217c8dfba237744966c2b5ab1e

Hello world works!!!!
This means cors is not the problem

WOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!! Solved bug. Had used the wrong path in the config file. Had used  https://miedweb.org/momsapp_v4/backend/index.php".But on the server i didnt have a "backend" folder. The files were directly in the momsapp_v4 folder. What probably happened was that a "Not found" message was sent to the client, which didnt have the allow-all-origin header.

2018-11-19 v5 starts
--------------------

Create v5. How do I copy the old project? Cant find react-router error message. npm install react-router. Then commented away import line, then inserted it again, and it worked. Then needed to do the same thing with react-router-dom

Clicking vote-panel gets stuck in Laddar data... Ah, wamp server is probably not running.

Server returns empty vats array. Run init_vats.php. Works!! v5 now up and running

V5 mission: Make app responsive

tests/test2_responsive_bar

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA1NW-T1QXc

Add meta tag: <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

@media screen and (max-width:800px) {
    .bar {
        width:600px;
    }
}

Doesnt work-- ah forgot to add px in medie query (). Fixed above.

https://responsivedesign.is/develop/browser-feature-support/media-queries-for-common-device-breakpoints/
https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-100-correct-way-to-do-css-breakpoints-88d6a5ba1862
https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_media_query_breakpoints.asp

https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/media-queries-responsive-design-2018/

Working on min-width. Idea: set breakpoint every 100px.

Ah, every time user resizes screen, button pos needs to be updated.

Doesnt work. Ah forgot the "px" again at max-width.

Complicatd. Can we use flex instead?

CSS grid works! But slider button needs to be reset after user resizes the screen. Where is the slider button set to start with? After get_vats from server? And buttons might have been moved, before resize, ie not all buttons might be 12%.

added resize handler. Didnt work at first. Had to use window.add and not document.body.add.

Hm the state hasnt changed. Thats why setState is not taking into effect.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30626030/can-you-force-a-react-component-to-rerender-without-calling-setstate

Added fifth column 10px to grid-columns. Now horizontal scroll disappeared. 

Ah let left = (this.props.val / 100) * (Config.SLIDER_WIDTH - Config.SLIDER_BUTTON_WIDTH);
in HorizontalSlider.js.

Oooo, added this.forceUpdate in VotePage.js. Now it works!

Next: fix slider background. Fixed!
